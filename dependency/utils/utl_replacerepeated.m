% rules may contain expression patterns (expressions containing blanks, named sub-expressions, conditional expressions in any mix)
%
% In:
%   In-Expression : some expression in which substitution shall take place
%   Rule-List     : cell array of substitution rules; may also be a struct, where field names are taken as symbol names
%
% Out:
%   Out-Expression : In-Expression with substitutions performed
%   Changed        : whether a replacement has taken place
%
% Notes:
%   Impure expressions degrade into pure expressions when substitutions are performed on them (i.e. they lose their attached value).
