% Internal. Complete the definition of a predicitive model with some meta-data.
% utl_complete_model(Model, PredictionFunction, Bundle)
% In:
%   Model : a predictive model that will be finalized by this function; may have the following fields:
%           .tracking.filter_graph : cell array of symbolic filter expressions, one per inlet of the
%                                    prediction function; can be used to filter streams or bundles
%
%                                    Can also be passed either as an EEGLAB data set (with .tracking
%                                    field) or as a stream bundle; in this case, the processing that
%                                    has been applied to those data sets will be used as a template
%                                    to lay out to set up the filter graph.
%
%                                    If not passed, will be filled in by the Bundle argument.
%
%           .tracking.prediction_function : function that takes a window of the output of filter graph's
%                                           output and computes a prediction from it; If not passed,
%                                           will be filled in based on the PredictionFunction argument 
%
%           .tracking.prediction_channels : cell array of chanlocs structures expected by the prediction
%                                           function; has one element for each inlet of the prediction 
%                                           function.
%
%                                           If not passed, will be filled in based on the Bundle argument.
%
%
%   PredictionFunction : handle of the prediction function (supplied by the framework code that calls 
%                        utl_complete_model)
%
%   Bundle : a stream bundle fully preprocessed by the filter graph, used to extract some
%            meta-data (supplied by framework code)
%
% Out:
%   Model : a completed model struct; the following fields are ensured to exist:
%           .tracking                --> tracking information about the model for offline/online processing
%            .filter_graph           --> a cell array of (symbolic) filter expressions, denoting the 
%                                        filter operations that yield each stream inlet that is 
%                                        accepted by the model's prediction function. Each expression
%                                        may contain leaf nodes of the type @rawdata, which are free
%                                        inlets of the filter graph (tagged with the channels expected
%                                        at that inlet)
%            .prediction_function    --> a function that takes a stream bundle with one stream for 
%                                        each entry of the filter graph; produces a prediction for each
%                                        epoch/segment in the data (therefore works both online and offline)
%            .prediction_channels    --> a cell array of chanlocs structs that defines that channels
%                                        expected by the prediction function at each of its inlets
%                                        (this is redundant additional information)
