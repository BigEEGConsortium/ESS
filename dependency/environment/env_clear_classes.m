function env_clear_classes
% Clear instances of BCI paradigm (and other) classes.
%
% This function is mainly useful when editing the code of BCI paradigms in BCILAB. Whenever after an
% edit a warning along the lines of "Cannot apply change to the class Paradigm*** because some
% instances of the old version still exist" comes up, this function may be called to clear all such
% stray instances without erasing the remaining state of BCILAB.
