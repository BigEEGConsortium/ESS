function outargs = hlp_resolve(x,default,context)
% Look up a symbol from the current hlp_scope scope.
% Data = hlp_resolve(Symbol,Default,Context)
%
% More precisely, perform a lookup for a symbol in the current (dynamic) scope formed by (possibly
% nested) hlp_scope(s). Returns a cell array of all the values associated with the symbol. Used to
% implement dynamic scoping across functions, used by parts of the expression & online system.
%
% In:
%   Symbol : a symbol (string or function handle) to look up; if omitted, the entire symbol frame
%            will be returned as a struct
%
%   Default : the default value, if the symbol does not exist (note: you may also omit the default
%             if you prefer to get an error in case the symbol does not exist)
%
%   Context : Optionally the execution context (stack) at this point, if known.
%             Can be obtained via try/catch.
%
% Out:
%   Data : the data associated with the symbol, or the symbol itself, if the lookup failed
%
% Examples:
%   % resolve the value of the symbol 'test' against the current dynamic scope
%   value = hlp_resolve('test')
