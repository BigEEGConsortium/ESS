function a = hlp_wrapresults(f,varargin)
% Wraps all outputs produced by function f for the given arguments into a cell array.
% Results = hlp_wrapresults(Function, Arguments...)
%
% In:
%   Function     : some function handle to execute
%
%   Arguments... : list of arguments to pass to the function
%
% Out:
%   Results : cell array of all function results
%
%
% Notes: 
%   It is not (currently) possible to efficiently determine the number of out-args for a 
%   varargout function; in this case, at most 10 outputs are supported.
%
% Examples:
%   % wrap both outputs of a particualr sort() call into a cell array
%   results = hlp_wrapresults(@sort,[1 4 2 1 3 6 0])
%

%   hlp_getresult
