{"name":"EEG Study Schema (ESS) and related tools","tagline":"Removing the pain from EEG data sharing","body":"EEG Study Schema (ESS) makes it easier for researcher in the field of EEG/BCI to package, share and automatize the analysis workflow of their study data.\r\n\r\n## Using other people’s EEG data could be painful\r\n\r\nOften one has to do detective work to find out:\r\n\r\n1. What happened in the experiment?\r\n2. Which files are for which subjects/sessions?\r\n3. What do these event codes mean?\r\n\r\n## To remove ‘EEG data sharing pain' we have created a set of standards (HED and ESS) and tools\r\n\r\nESS is designed from a user-centered viewpoint that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It is created to contain all the information a researcher unfamiliar with a particular EEG (or MEG) Study needs to further analyze the data. It is\r\n\r\n* An XML-based specification \r\n* Holds all the information necessary to analyze an EEG study: task and paradigm description, recording parameters, sensor locations, gender, handedness, age and group associations of subjects…\r\n* Contains a table of HED tags for event codes.  \r\n* Both human- and machine-readable\r\n* The XML file may be readily formatted into a readable description of the EEG study \r\n\r\nESS also has a convention that specifies how to name and arrange raw session EEG recording files into folders.\r\n\r\n## ESS 2.0 is ready\r\n\r\nYou can see [ESS 2.0 specification here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFnyVpY60jhP3FDL2fMqSmoisN5EreQBxD5YnrAo0pU/edit?usp=sharing). It is now capable of dealing with multiple modalities (e.g. Motion Capture, Eye-Tracking,...), and studies where EEG recording parameters (e.g. sampling rate) vary across sessions.\r\n\r\n## ESS tools\r\n\r\nFree open-source MATLAB-based tools are available in [ESS Github repository](https://github.com/bigdelys/ESS) to read and write ESS XML files. You can use these tools to automate the process of loading data from study sessions and applying (e.g. EEGLAB) analysis scripts on your data.\r\n\r\n## Download ESS-formatted EEG studies\r\n\r\n[HeadIT.org](http://headIT.org) contains a diverse set of well-documented EEG studies in ESS format. Here is a list of some available paradigms:\r\n\r\n* [RSVP Target Detection](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/8004e8ee-a236-11e2-b5e7-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Auditory-Visual Attention Shift](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/8d6dbb78-a236-11e2-b5e7-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Auditory Two-Choice Response Task with an Ignored Feature Difference](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/9d557882-a236-11e2-9420-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Reward Two-Back CPT](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/ba6d6d12-a236-11e2-9420-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Modified Sternberg Working Memory Task] (http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/e5e644be-a236-11e2-b5e7-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Imagined Emotion](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/3316f70e-35ff-11e3-a2a9-0050563f2612)\r\n* [visual spatial selective attentional oddball](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/2747adbc-385a-11e3-b29d-0050563f2612)\r\n\r\n## People\r\n\r\nESS 2.0 specifications were drafted by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo, PhD (Syntrogi, Inc.) and Prof. Kay Robbins (University of Texas at San Antonio). ESS 1.0 specifications were drafted by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo, PhD,  Jessica Hsi (UCSD) and Prof. Scott Makeig (Swartz Center for Computational Neueorsciece, UCSD).\r\n\r\nPlease send your question about ESS to Nima Bigdely-Shamlo, email nima.bigdely [put at sign here] syntrogi.com.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nESS was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI).
