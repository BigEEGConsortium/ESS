{"name":"ESS","tagline":"EEG Study Schema (ESS) and related tools.","body":"## Using other people’s EEG data is painful\r\n\r\nOften one has to do detective work to find out:\r\n\r\n1. What happened in the experiment?\r\n2. Which files are for which subjects/sessions?\r\n3. What do these event codes mean?\r\n\r\n## To remove ‘EEG data sharing pain' we have created a set of standards (HED and ESS) and tools\r\n\r\nESS is\r\n\r\n* An XML-based specification \r\n* Holds all the information necessary to analyze an EEG study: task and paradigm description, recording parameters, sensor locations, gender, handedness, age and group associations of subjects…\r\n* Contains a table of HED tags for event codes.  \r\n* Both human- and machine-readable\r\n* The XML file may be readily formatted into a readable description of the EEG study \r\n\r\nESS has two parts (a) a convention for structering raw EEG recording files (b) an XML file that holds all the information necessary to analyze an EEG study. Together ESS and HED provide a metadata hierarchy for describing and documenting electrophysiological studies and their recorded data. ESS is designed from a user-centered viewpoint that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It is created to contain all the information a researcher unfamiliar with a particular EEG (or MEG) Study needs to further analyze the data. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nESS was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). ESS development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Labaratory.\r\n","google":"UA-1790906-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
