{"name":"EEG Study Schema (ESS) and related tools","tagline":"Removing the pain from EEG data sharing","body":"![](/images/ESS_logo_ship.png)\r\n\r\nEEG Study Schema (ESS) makes it easier for researcher in the field of EEG/BCI to package, share and automatize the analysis workflow of their study data. \r\n\r\nYou can think of ESS as a \"shipping container\" for your EEG study data.\r\n\r\n## Using other people’s EEG data could be painful\r\n\r\nOften one has to do detective work to find out:\r\n\r\n1. What happened in the experiment?\r\n2. Which files are for which subjects/sessions?\r\n3. What do these event codes mean?\r\n\r\n## To remove ‘EEG data sharing pain' we have created a set of standards (HED and ESS) and tools\r\n\r\nESS is designed from a user-centered viewpoint that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It is created to contain all the information a researcher unfamiliar with a particular EEG (or MEG) Study needs to further analyze the data. It is\r\n\r\n* An XML-based specification \r\n* Holds all the information necessary to analyze an EEG study: task and paradigm description, recording parameters, sensor locations, gender, handedness, age and group associations of subjects…\r\n* Contains a table of [HED tags](http://www.hedtags.org) for event codes.  \r\n* Both human- and machine-readable\r\n* The XML file may be readily formatted into a readable description of the EEG study \r\n\r\nESS also has a convention that specifies how to name and arrange raw session EEG recording files into folders.\r\n\r\n## ESS 2.0\r\n\r\nThe latest version of ESS allows for multiple levels of data and inclusion of multiple data modalities (e.g. gaze, motion-capture) in addition to EEG. Fig. 1 shows stages of data and tools used to transform data into ESS standard levels.\r\n\r\n![](/images/ESS process.png)\r\nFigure 1: Stages of data and tools used to transform data into ESS standard levels.\r\n\r\nYou can see [ESS 2.0 specification here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFnyVpY60jhP3FDL2fMqSmoisN5EreQBxD5YnrAo0pU/edit?usp=sharing). It is now capable of dealing with multiple modalities (e.g. Motion Capture, Eye-Tracking,...), and studies where EEG recording parameters (e.g. sampling rate) vary across sessions.\r\n\r\n## ESS tools\r\n\r\nFree open-source MATLAB-based tools are available in [ESS Github repository](https://github.com/bigdelys/ESS) to read and write ESS XML files. You can use these tools to automate the process of loading data from study sessions and applying (e.g. EEGLAB) analysis scripts on your data.\r\n\r\n## Download ESS-formatted EEG studies\r\n\r\n[HeadIT.org](http://headIT.org) contains a diverse set of well-documented EEG studies in ESS format. Here is a list of some available paradigms:\r\n\r\n* [RSVP Target Detection](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/8004e8ee-a236-11e2-b5e7-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Auditory-Visual Attention Shift](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/8d6dbb78-a236-11e2-b5e7-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Auditory Two-Choice Response Task with an Ignored Feature Difference](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/9d557882-a236-11e2-9420-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Reward Two-Back CPT](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/ba6d6d12-a236-11e2-9420-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Modified Sternberg Working Memory Task] (http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/e5e644be-a236-11e2-b5e7-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Imagined Emotion](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/3316f70e-35ff-11e3-a2a9-0050563f2612)\r\n* [Visual Spatial selective Attentional Oddball](http://headit-beta.ucsd.edu/studies/2747adbc-385a-11e3-b29d-0050563f2612)\r\n\r\n## Example code\r\n\r\n### Running a function on all the recording in the study\r\n```\r\n% load the container in to a MATLAB object\r\nobj = level2Study('level2XmlFilePath', 'C:\\Users\\...\\[ESS Container Folder]\\');\r\n\r\n% get all the recording files \r\nfilenames = obj.getFilename;\r\n\r\n% Step through all the recordings and apply a function\r\nfor i=1:length(filenames)\r\n    [path name ext] = fileparts(filenames{i});\r\n    EEG = pop_loadset([name ext], path);\r\n\tEEG = [YOUR FUNCTION](EEG,..)\r\nend;\r\n```\r\nYou can limit the tasks for which the files are obtained by using 'taskLabel' option of getFilename() method in level2Study class.\r\n\r\n### Creating An EEGLAB STUDY\r\n\r\n```\r\n% load the container in to a MATLAB object\r\nobj = level2Study('level2XmlFilePath', 'C:\\Users\\...\\[ESS Container Folder]\\');\r\n\r\nstudyFilenameAndPAth = createEeglabStudy(obj, 'C:\\Users\\Nima\\Documents\\MATLAB\\tools\\playground\\eeglabstudy');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Making sure the container has no issues (validation)\r\n```\r\n% load the container in to a MATLAB object\r\nobj = level2Study('level2XmlFilePath', 'C:\\Users\\...\\[ESS Container Folder]\\');\r\n\r\nobj = obj.validate;\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome minor issues, like missing UUIDs are fixed by default in the validation process, but you need to save the object afterwards.\r\n## People\r\n\r\nESS 2.0 specifications were drafted by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo ([Syntrogi, Inc.](http://www.syntrogi.com)), Kay Robbins (University of Texas at San Antonio) and Tony Johnson (DCS Corp.).
