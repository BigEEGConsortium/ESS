%CONFPLOT_T Linear plot with graded confidence/error boundaries.
%
%   [handle] = CONFPLOT_T(x,y,s,N,P,CM,[revCM?],[lim],[gamma],[fig]) 
%
%   plots the graph of vector X vs. vector Y with a graded error 
%   boundary which varies in color or shades of gray according to a t
%   distribution for sample size N, at the probabilities in P.
%
%   Required parameters:
%   x, y, s, and N are vectors of the same size.
%   s is the standard deviation of y at each point in x.
%   N is the number of observations (y) at each point in x.
%      N may be a scalar if the number of observation is constant.
%   P is a discrete monotonic set of probabilities in the range (0,0.5].
%      P determines the extent of the error boundary, and also the its
%      granularity (smoothness). For example, P = [0.01:0.01:0.5]
%   CM is a function handle to a color-map-generating function, passed in
%      using the @ syntaxt. For example, @gray.
%   
%  Optional parameters:
%  [revCM?] Reverse the order of the colors in the colormap? (1/0)
%  [lim]    Limits on the range of meaningful values in y.
%           For example, if y are correlation coefficients, then y must be in
%           the range [-1,1]. This prevents the error boundary from "spilling"
%           out beyond what makes sense for y.
%  [gamma]  Allows for gamma correction. If you don't know what gamma
%           correction is about, just know that gamma is applied as an
%           exponent to the color map, like this: CM.^gamma.
%  [fig]    If you want the plot to show up in a specific figure, pass in the
%           figure handle here. The default is to plot within the currently
%           active figure, or open a new figure if none is open.
%
%  Returns: an optional figure handle
