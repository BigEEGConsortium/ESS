          <p>ESS has two parts (a) a convention for structering raw EEG recording files (b) an XML file that holds all the information necessary to analyze an EEG study (e.g., task and paradigm description, recording parameters, sensor locations, gender, handedness, age and group associations of subjects, etc.) in a format that is both human- and machine-readable (meaning the XML file may be readily formatted into a readable description of the EEG study). ESS embeds HED descriptions of experimental events and tasks along with subject information such as handedness and gender, into an ESS XML document,. Together ESS and HED provide a metadata hierarchy for describing and documenting electrophysiological studies and their recorded data. ESS is designed from a user-centered viewpoint that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It is created to contain all the information a researcher unfamiliar with a particular EEG (or MEG) Study needs to further analyze the data. </p>

<p>ESS was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). ESS development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Labaratory.</p>
